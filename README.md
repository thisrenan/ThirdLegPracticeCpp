This list of exercises is related to C++ programming studies and corresponds to the third part of the study.

The list is focused in vector manipulation.

# Welcome to the Third C++ Practice

Remember to use vector in all the execises.

1. Write an algorithm that reads a vector of 30 positions and reports how many elements are multiples of 2 and how many are multiples of 3.

2. Build an algorithm that requests 5 values ​​from the user, stores them in a vector of 5 integer positions. Then, find out how many elements are greater than the element in the first position.

3. Write an algorithm that reads two vectors of 10 positions and multiplies the elements with the same index, placing the result in a third vector. Display the resulting vector.

4. Write an algorithm that reads two vectors (A and B) of ten integer positions. The algorithm must then subtract the first element of A from the last element of B, and accumulate the value, subtract the second element of A from the penultimate element of B, accumulating the result, and so on. Display the result of the accumulated sum.

5. Write a program that reads two one-dimensional vectors A and B, of size 8, and exchanges the elements of these vectors; In other words, after executing the program, vector B should contain the values ​​provided for vector A, and vice versa.

6. Build an algorithm that requests 5 integer values ​​from the user and stores them in a vector. Then, the values ​​of the vector should be inverted using a second vector.

7. Build an algorithm that requests 5 integer values ​​from the user and stores them in a vector. Then, the values ​​of the vector should be inverted without using a second vector.

8. Write a program that loads a vector with 10 integer elements and checks for the existence of elements that are multiples of 5, showing the positions in which these elements appear.

9. Read 30 values ​​and place the even values ​​in one vector and the odd values ​​in another. After reading, calculate the sum of the two vectors and display the one with the highest value.

10. Build an algorithm that fills a vector with 5 integer values. Then check if the number 7 is in the vector. If so, display the position in which it was found. If it is found more than once, also show how many times it was found.

11. Write an algorithm that fills a vector of 10 positions with random numbers (between 10 and 30) and informs how many numbers are multiples of 5, and in which position they are found.

12. Build an algorithm that requests 5 values ​​from the user, stores them in a vector of 5 integer positions. Then check if the number 7 is in the vector. If so, display the position in which it was found. If it is found more than once, also show how many times it was found.

13. Write an algorithm that fills a vector of 10 positions with generated values ​​(use rand), and ensures that there are no repeated numbers. Then, sort the vector and show it on the screen.
    
14. Write a program that fills a vector of 30 positions with the first prime numbers starting from 333. Display the resulting vector on the screen.

15. Create an algorithm that fills two vectors of size 10 (without having repeated elements within the vector itself). Then, create a third vector that is the union between the first two vectors. Note: the union vector is composed of all the elements of both vectors, without repetition. Example:

- Vector1: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 17, 20]
- Vector2:[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15]
- VectorResult: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20]

16. Create an algorithm that fills two vectors of size 10 (without having repeated elements within the vector itself). Then, create a third vector that is the intersection between the first two vectors. Note: the intersection vector is composed of all elements in common in both vectors. Example:

- Vector1: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 17, 20]
- Vector2:[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15]
- VectorResult: [3, 4, 6, 7, 15]

17. Create an algorithm that fills two vectors of size 10 (without having repeated elements within the vector itself). Then, create a third vector that is the difference between the first two vectors. Note: a difference vector is one formed by the elements that are in Vector A, but not in Vector B. Example:

- Vector1: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 17, 20]
- Vector2:[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15]
- VectorResult: [1, 10, 16, 17, 20]

18. Fill two vectors of size 5. Then create a third vector composed by merging the first two.

- Vector1: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]
- Vector2:[2, 5, 8, 9, 10]
- VectorResult: [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 8, 6, 9, 7, 10]
